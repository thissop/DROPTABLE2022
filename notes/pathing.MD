* **Bug Pathing**: Simple pathing algo, "free pathing" vs "follow pathing" ... _include notes 17:40 from to 18:40_
    * low power because the bug only has to check a few locations and see if they can move to them. 
    * **Refined Bug Pathing**: takes _22:45 to ~24 min, especially 23:40-24:15_
* Two cs presentation links: [first](https://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/academics/788XF14/788XF14L14/788XF14L14.pathbugsmapsx.pdf), [second](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~motionplanning/lecture/Chap2-Bug-Alg_howie.pdf****) (both are long)
* ~~ Watched up to ~26 min in video ~~
