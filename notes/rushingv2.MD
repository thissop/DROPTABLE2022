* perhaps we can actually get a very simple soldier rushing routine working? 
* we can use the "bee state" like idea we had based on soldier id[-1] to scout in three general directions based on nearest HQ location: the vertical symmetry guess, the horizontal symmetry guess, and the rotational symmetry guess. 
* I think I will actually test a pure rushing, no watch towers bot today that runs the soldiers once 20 soldiers have been made
